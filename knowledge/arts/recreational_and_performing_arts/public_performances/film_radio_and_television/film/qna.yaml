      LGBTQ+ actors: Colman Domingo, Jodie Foster, and Lily Gladstone. Gladstone also became the first Native American actress 
      to be nominated. Scott George, who wrote the music and lyrics to "Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People)", became the first 
      member of the Osage Nation to be nominated for an Academy Award.
      This was the fifth consecutive year with at least one Best Picture nominee directed by a woman: Greta Gerwig with Barbie, 
      Celine Song with Past Lives, and Justine Triet with Anatomy of a Fall. Triet also became the eighth woman nominated for 
      Best Director. Overall, six couples received nominations that they shared together in their respective categories.

      Jimmy Kimmel hosted the 96th Academy Awards, his fourth overall.
      On October 17, 2023, Hamish Hamilton was announced as director. On November 15, Jimmy Kimmel was announced as host, 
      returning for the second consecutive year and fourth Academy Awards overall. On November 30, 2023, ABC and the Academy 
      announced that the start time of the ceremony would be moved up by an hour to 4:00 p.m. PT (7:00 p.m. ET). This change 
      enabled ABC to air a half-hour of primetime programming as a lead-out, featuring a new episode of its sitcom 
      Abbott Elementary. An American Sign Language livestream was broadcast on the Academy's YouTube page featuring 
      video of interpreters.
      The pre-show was hosted for the third consecutive year by Vanessa Hudgens, joined by new co-host Julianne Hough. 
      Due to the scheduling change, the pre-show was shortened to 30 minutes. The beginning of the ceremony was delayed 
      by six minutes, due to arrivals being slowed by Israel–Hamas war protests outside of the theatre.
      On January 29, 2024, comedian and broadcaster Amelia Dimoldenberg, host of the YouTube interview series Chicken Shop Date, 
      was announced as the social media ambassador and red carpet correspondent. Dimoldenberg was involved in multiple 
      Oscar season events, including the Oscars Nominees luncheon, where she participated in an Academy video production 
      with nominees. She was also involved interviewing people at the Oscars red carpet and the "Oscars 96 Behind the Scenes Tour".
      Presenters were announced in a series of groups beginning on February 26, 2024. Performers were announced on 
      February 28, 2024. After the first batch of presenters was announced, The Hollywood Reporter learned that the 
      Academy would revive a popular presenting format previously used in 2009, where five Oscar-winning actors for 
      leading and supporting performances took the stage together to introduce the current nominees in their 
      respective categories. David Alan Grier was selected as the event's announcer.
      Production designers Alana Billingsley and Misty Buckley designed the stage over the course of nine months. According 
      to Billingsley and Buckley, they were inspired by contemporary spaces where people can "meet, exchange, create [like] 
      a modern-day plaza". Throughout the ceremony, the stage subtly changed its design to honor the nominees; the screenplay 
      categories included images of real typewriters, while the Best Costume Design category showcased images of several of 
      the nominated costumes.
      Messi the Dog from Anatomy of a Fall attended the ceremony and had his own seat in the audience. According to The 
      Hollywood Reporter, multiple companies with nominated films had complained to the Academy about him attending the 
      Oscar nominees luncheon and giving the film an advantage for voting. Before the ceremony, the show's host, Jimmy Kimmel, 
      shared a video in which he could be seen rehearsing his Oscars jokes with Messi. He also made a surprise appearance in 
      the audience of the show and appeared to urinate on Matt Damon's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame as part of the 
      ongoing Damon–Kimmel feud.
      Nominees Kaouther Ben Hania, Finneas O'Connell, Billie Eilish, and Mark Ruffalo, as well as presenters Ramy Youssef 
      and Mahershala Ali, wore red Artists4Ceasefire badges calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.
